# Archon
<sup>/ˈɑːr.kɒn/ -> “AR-kon”, "Ark-on", "Ar-chon"</sup><br/>

During my time as an admin for a few Discord servers, and as a perfectionist, I always had the problem of not having enough customization, control, and/or configuration when trying to use a bot for the servers needs. And, even if I did, it would usually be behind a pay wall or the feature was limited to only a few uses/implementations.

I plan to make Archon a kind of *"power-tool"* with multitudes of configuration for all modules, no limits.

It's up to the user to configure and maintain it. Each module will be disabled by default, no bloat, no unnecessary defaults. Just a blank slate, everything greyed out for the task of whatever configuration you have desired.

## Possible Features
- Visually customizable dashboard for easy configuration on all your servers

Thinking of making the backend for this in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).

- Keep as much source-code as openly viewable as securely possible
- Advanced, user-friendly, and intuitive reaction roles

Inspiration from Tech's [Reaction Roles](https://reactionroles.mtdv.me/) bot.

- Cron jobs/automation of any sorts
- Logging for almost every event

Events listed at [Readthedocs - API Events](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord-api-events).

- Welcome/leave triggers
- Leveling system
- Starboard
- Embeds

## Archon's Philosophy
Archon's philosophy gravitates alongside that of what the name is relative to - Arch Linux, not just the literal meaning of the word.

And, much like Arch, Archon empowers users through responsibility, offers flexibility with its modular design, as configurable as Arch, and independently maintainable. At the same time, handing out transparency and user control with this GitHub repository, clear documentation (yet to be written), and encouraged manual configuration.

Anyway, about the literal meaning of the word. Archon comes from ancient Greek, meaning “ruler” or “magistrate”. In Classical Athens, an archon was a high-ranking official who had administrative, judicial, and sometimes military authority. The term literally conveys leadership, control, and authority.
